OpenWhisk is a cloud-first distributed event-based programming service. 
It provides a programming model to upload event handlers to a cloud service, and register the handlers to respond to various events. 
Learn more at the main repository [openwhisk](https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk) 

This repository contains an interactive tutorials for the OpenWhisk CLI. 


Whisk Tutorial
===============

The Whisk tutorial is an interactive learning environment to get familiar with the whisk command line.


Development Guide:
==================
This project uses a simplified Django structure, builds on Django 1.6 and uses Python 2.7. 


Setting up the application:
=================
1. Clone whisk-tutorial repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the whisk-tutorial folder

Running locally: 
=================
To run the application locally, execute the following commands from the whisk-tutorial directory:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

`python manage.py runserver localhost:8080`

Running with Docker
=================
If you don't want bother run locally, you can run the tutorial in Docker with following comand:

`docker build -t openwhisk-tutorial .`
This command will help build the tutorial docker image.

`sudo docker run --name whisk-tutorial  -p 8081:8000 -d openwhisk-tutorial`
THis command will start a container running the tutorial app with name whisk-tutorial, and map
port 8081 from host to port 8000 in the container.

Now, open your host web browser, and nagivate to http://localhost:8081, you should be able to practice
with the tutorial now.

Running on Bluemix:
===================
There are two options to deploy to bluemix - manually and through the "deploy" button.     

Click to Deploy:
----------
[![Deploy to Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button_x2.png)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk-tutorial.git)

Manual Deployment:
-------------
  1. Change the name field in the manifest.yml to a preferred name   
  2. Execute `cf push` from the whisk-tutorial directory  
   
Delete app from bluemix:
----------

   `cf delete learnwhisk`

NOTE: You will need to register for a Bluemix account.

Install dev tools:
===================
install coffee-script: `npm install -g coffee-script`   

install django-markdown-deux: `pip install django-markdown-deux`
   
Adding Tutorial/Trails links:
===========================
1. Locate home.md in the templates directory(i.e. whisk-tutorial/whisk_tutorial/tutorial/templates/home.md)
2. Add a new div tag to the tutorial links div


Adding/Updating steps
=======================
All the steps are stored in arrays. The basic tutorial is stored in 'q' while the advanced tutorial
is stored in 'adv_q' both of which can be found in steps.coffee. If you follow the pattern in the steps.coffee 
file it should be fairly trivial to figure out how to modify a question. When steps.cofee is modified you
will need to compile the .coffee files to javascript file. For this you will need to have coffee-script 
installed on your computer. see "Install dev tools" section above. 

1. Open the steps.coffee file that is located in whisk_tutorial/static/js directory.
2. Locate the corresponding queue to which you'd like add a step to. For example, trigger_q holds all the step items for the trigger tutorial. 
3. Push a new item to the corresponding q. You can reuse the structure from previous steps.   
   Example: trigger_q.push({...})

compilation command: `coffee -c steps.coffee`
this will generate the steps.js file.

Updating the wsk cli interpreter
================================
The interpreter is written in terminal.coffee, in the 'wsk' function. The itepreter logic is a set of 
if else statements. The logic flow is pretty straight forward. To generate the js file, run the following:

1. Open the terminal.coffee file that is located in the whisk_tutorial/static/js directory.
2. Adding a new command to the interpreter:    
  1. Locate "WSK Interpreter" comment block    
  2. Add a new if clause to the wsk if-else code block and echo to the corresponding variable holding the content for the output   
  3. Adding content for the output of a command:  
     a. Locate "WSK Content" comment block.   
     b. Create a new variable holding the output content for the command to be added.   
3. Compile the terminal.coffee file:   
  1. `coffee -c terminal.coffee` 


Styling
==========
Styling can be found in the tutorial-style.css file.
